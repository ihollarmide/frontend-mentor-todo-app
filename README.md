## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Beautiful DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For drag and drop

### What I learned
- React Context API - I used this for theming


### Continued development
- Implement a better, more efficient and less redundant way to theming in React using React Context with or without styled components.
- React refs - I had problems with this while trying to use the react beautiful dnd library. I wish to learn and fully understand it

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp - How to Add Drag and Drop in React with React Beautiful DnD](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/) - This is an amazing article which guided me on how to add the drag and drop feature to the app using the react-beautiful-dnd library
- [Stackoverflow - Function components cannot be given refs with React Beautiful DND](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68361643/function-components-cannot-be-given-refs-with-react-beautiful-dnd/68361783#68361783) - Here is the question I asked on Stack Overflow that helped me to solve the innerRef problem I was having with the react-beautiful-dnd library
